Questions I would ask to help understand question:
1. What if some NFT dictionaries donâ€™t have a "name" key?
2. Can the collection be empty? What should be returned then?

Plan in plain English (pseudocode):
Create an empty list. Loop through each NFT in the collection. Extract the value of the "name" key and append to the list. Return the list at the end.
